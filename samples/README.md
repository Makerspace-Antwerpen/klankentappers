Ramping samples for testing mics, created with Audacity:

* Generate 1 minute of whitenoise
* Use Graphic EQ to perform pass filter
* Amplify to 1dB peak amplitude with clipping
* 7x Fade In
* Save as WAV

whitenoise-full = all frequencies
whitenoise-low = 0Hz-200Hz
whitenoise-mid = 200Hz-2000Hz
whitenoise-high = 2000Hz-20000+Hz
